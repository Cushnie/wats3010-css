        Poem

        <ul>

            In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</li>
            A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
            Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
            Through caverns measureless to man<br>
            Down to a sunless sea.<br>
            So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
            With walls and towers were girdled round:<br>
            And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
            Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
            And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
            Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br>

            <p>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
            Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
            A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
            As e&rsquo;er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
            By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
            And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
            As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
            A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
            Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
            Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
            Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher&rsquo;s flail:<br>
            And &rsquo;mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
            It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
            Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
            Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
            Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
            And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:<br>
            And &rsquo;mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
            Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
            The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
            Floated midway on the waves;<br>
            Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
            From the fountain and the caves.<br>
            It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
            A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br>

            <p>A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
            In a vision once I saw:<br>
            It was an Abyssinian maid,<br>
            And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
            Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
            Could I revive within me<br>
            Her symphony and song,<br>
            To such a deep delight &rsquo;twould win me<br>
            That with music loud and long<br>
            I would build that dome in air,<br>
            That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
            And all who heard should see them there,<br>
            And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
            His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
            Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
            And close your eyes with holy dread,<br>
            For he on honey-dew hath fed<br>
            And drunk the milk of Paradise.<br>
        </ul>
